# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the RSVP app uses:

- This project uses the [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack). The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.
- For persistent storage, the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). This app uses a simple storage schema and saves it to a local database.
- For communication to the backend, the app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
